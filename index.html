				<p>People always find it funny when I talk about how much I love the rain. </p>

				<p>Coming from temperate 75 degrees and sunny Southern California made rain a special occasion. </p>

				<p>Spending time with my Native grandparents proved this point further because they told my sister and I that we had the power to summon the rain. </p>

				<p>Growing up Native always felt like I had a secret super power no one else had. I had the power to control the weather and I was connected to the earth. My soul was one with the elements because of my Navajo heritage.</p> 

				<p>In kindergarten, we were asked to make a paper cutout that represents our cultural background. </p>

				<p>My mom and I made a honey skinned cutout in a traditional Navajo tan dress. In her hand, she held a Mexican flag and an Italian flag to represent the other parts of my makeup. </p>

				<p>I am proud to be Native, but I have always struggled feeling “native enough” to claim it as part of my identity. </p>

				<p>I know that not everybody grew up doing rain dances with their grandparents or going to powwows and enjoying fry bread, but somehow it still never felt like enough.</p> 

				<p>I grew up in a predominantly white area of Orange County. I would tell other people I was Mexican or Native, and they’d laugh. </p>

				<p>I hesitated claiming the identity. </p>

				<p>It wasn’t until freshman year, I realized how much being a person of color had affected my life. </p>

				<p>While I am privileged to have a fairly light skin tone, I was still othered for the difference in comparison to my peers. </p>

				<p>They’d ask about my secret for maintaining my tan throughout winter and make little comments I never realized were chipping away at my identity. </p>

				<p>One of my ex-boyfriends in high school threatened to break up with me if I got any darker and called me derogatory slurs. </p>

				<p>After high school, this came crashing down on me with a wave of fury. The fury motivated me and drove me to claim my native identity with my whole heart. </p>

				<p>Being a person of color in America, in California and at USC brings daily challenges, but I face them with my head held high. And not only am I a person of color but I am an Indigenous person of color. </p>

				<p>America has a cute habit of erasing the ugly parts of our past, which is why the mass genocide of Native Americans is rarely more than a chapter in a high school textbook. </p>

				<p>Higher education provides opportunities to learn more, however, it requires a student to seek this out or stumble into this class because it was “the only GE-C with space left.” </p>

				<p>When we were thinking about subjects for the Daily Trojan features supplement, I immediately thought of Indigenous Peoples’ Day. </p>

				<p>When Los Angeles stopped celebrating Christopher Columbus, it meant so much to so many of us. Indigenous narratives barely exist as is, and that was the first victory I can ever remember in my lifetime. </p>

				<p>The same goes for being Native at a predominantly white university. We are grasping for straws just to create safe spaces for us to exist. </p>

				<p>For too long, Native students' voices have been hushed and ignored. I am beyond proud we are producing this supplement to elevate the Native student experience. </p>
